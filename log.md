# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 29, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- Devised a roadmap/ plan for the concepts that I need to learn or revise.
- Selected the list of problems that I need to solve.
- Created appropriate repos for the same.

**Thoughts:** 
- Planned of what all concepts need to be learnt.
- Also for improving logic building I've decided to solve top 100 codes list by prep insta which covers all basic problems that will help to build logic.
- The solution to the problems will be added on github repo named Problem-Solving-Mastery which will be helpful for me to revist anytime as will also work as notebook for all the problems that I've solved over the time.

**Link(s) to work:** [Plan](https://github.com/TheParthMaru/100-days-of-code/blob/master/plan.md), [Coding problems to be solved](https://prepinsta.com/top-100-codes/), [My github repo for solved problems](https://github.com/TheParthMaru/Problem-Solving-Mastery)

### Day 1: June 30, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- Thoroughly revised fundamental concepts as per the plan.
- Solved 12 basic level problems.

**Thoughts:** 
- Revision was quick as it just took around 45 mins to revise the concepts.
- Solved problems based on those concepts which were a piece of cake.

- Solving just with pen and paper is quite difficult as you have to rely completely on dry running to check correctness of your answer.
