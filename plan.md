# Plan for 100 Days of Code
## Goals
- Learn Java efficiently
- Solve problems daily (atleast 1 new problem everyday)
- Minimum daily 1 hour theoretical learning and applying concepts
- Minimum daily 1 hour problem solving
- Start with DSA after completing Java

## Topics to cover in Java
### Fundamentals of Programming in Java
- Introduction to Java
  - Just go through what Java is, its features, advantages, etc as it may be asked as an interview question.
  - JDK, JRE, JVM
  - First Program, learn the compilation and intepretation process.
  - Comments in Java
- Data Types and Variables
  - Primitive Data Types (boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float and double)
  - Non-Primitive Data Types
    - String (just understand how to use, do not go with the depth of its implementation)
    - Arrays, Classes, Interface (Just know its existence)
  - Variables
    - Naming conventions
    - Types of variables (local, static, instance) (for now only local is required, static and instance are covered in OOP)
- Type Conversion, Type Casting, Overflow, Underflow
- Operators
  - Arithmetic operators
  - Relational operators
  - Logical operators
  - Assignment operator
  - Unary operator
  - Bitwise operator
  - Ternary operator
- Conditional statements
  - if...else
  - switch
- Looping statements
  - while
  - do while
  - for
  - for each (Covered in Collection Framework)
- Jump statements
  - break
  - continue
- Methods
  - Defining a method
  - Calling a method
  - Types of method (instance, abstract, static) will be covered in depth in OOP.

### Object Oriented Programming
- Introduction
  - Classes
  - Objects
  - Ways to instantiate an object
- Constructor
  - Types of constructors (default, no-arg, parameterized)
  - Constructor overloading / Constructor chaining
- this keyword
  - Major use cases
